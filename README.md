# chime-go
A [Chime][chime] extension for Go.

## Overview

This Chime extension supports the [Go][go] programming language. It integrates [gopls][gopls] with [ChimeKit][chimekit]'s `ExtensionProtocol`.

Currently, chime-go depends on a pre-built version of gopls being available inside the containing `.appex` bundle. This is a limitation that will eventually be removed.

## Installation

chime-go's core functionality is built directly into Chime 2.0.
